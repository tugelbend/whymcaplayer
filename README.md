Small processing script to play mp3 tracks according to a dynamic playlist when a button on a Playstation Move Controller is pressed.

This script has been used to play 20 second long tracks (different versions of the "YMCA" refrain) when someone hits a buzzer. Check the source code for details.

The buzzer has been connected to a Playstation Move Controller. Therefore you will need the PSMove API (https://thp.io/2010/psmove/) installed on your computer.

The script can also be used using the keyboard.

"No big deal" you might say and you are right ;-). I just uploaded it here as a processing mp3 player example and for my personal backup of course.

Script has been tested with Processing 2.2.1 on linux.

## General usage

Create a data folder in the where the script files are located and add the tracks you want to play. As I don't have the licenses needed I couldn't add the original files. Adjust the code according to the number of files you want to play and according to the file names of course.
